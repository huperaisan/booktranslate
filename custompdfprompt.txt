The image is a scan of a page from a German scholarly book on Greek and Roman antiquity. Most of the text is in German, but there are also quotations in Greek and Latin. Your task is to understand the text, translate everything into ENGLISH while leaving Greek and Latin quotations untranslated, and format the translated text as a HTML document as it would be in a scholarly translation. Accuracy is key. Pay special attention to FOOTNOTES, which are found at the bottom of the page in SMALLER font. If you encounter fragments of sentences, do not leave them out but do your best to translate them. Use 'font-family: serif' for the main text and 'font-family: Palatino' for Greek text. Do not use tables or line-height or any heading tags (e.g. <h1>). Return ONLY the HTML content, beginning with <!DOCTYPE html> and ending with </html>.
